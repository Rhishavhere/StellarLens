## üî¨ Scientific Background

### Schwarzschild Metric and Gravitational Lensing

The Schwarzschild metric describes the spacetime geometry around a non-rotating, spherically symmetric mass such as a black hole. In Schwarzschild coordinates, the line element is:

$$
ds^2 = -\left(1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right)c^2dt^2 + \left(1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right)^{-1}dr^2 + r^2(d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2)
$$

where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the black hole, $c$ is the speed of light, and $r$ is the radial coordinate. Light rays (null geodesics) passing near the black hole are deflected due to spacetime curvature.

### Einstein Deflection Angle

For a light ray passing at impact parameter $b$ (distance of closest approach), the total deflection angle $\alpha$ in the weak-field limit is:

$$
\alpha \approx \frac{4GM}{c^2 b}
$$

This is the classic Einstein formula for gravitational lensing. For strong lensing (close to the event horizon), higher-order terms or numerical integration of the geodesic equations are required.

### Algorithmic Implementation

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Ray Tracing** | Traces light rays backward from the camera through each pixel, computing deflection based on the Schwarzschild metric |
| **GLSL Shader** | Computes apparent position of background sources using lensing deflection, utilizing black hole mass and event horizon parameters |
| **Numerical Integration** | For accurate near-horizon visualization, integrates the null geodesic equations: $$\left(\frac{du}{d\phi}\right)^2 + u^2 = \frac{1}{b^2}$$ where $u = 1/r$ and $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle |

### Summary

The project combines the Schwarzschild metric, Einstein's deflection formula, and real-time GPU-based ray tracing to visualize gravitational lensing. The approach balances analytic solutions for efficiency and numerical integration for accuracy near the event horizon, all implemented in performant GLSL shaders for interactive exploration.
